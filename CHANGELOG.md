# [3.0.0](https://github.com/kevinoid/stream-compare/compare/v2.0.0...v3.0.0) (2020-04-26)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Additional events after `'end'` are compared by default, if they occur before
  the event queue becomes empty since the previous event (i.e. before
  `setImmediate` from the last event on a stream).
* `options.delay` applies after `setImmediate` from the last event.
* Drop support for Node.js before 10.13.


### Bug Fixes

* `makeIncremental` now considers whether additional events are expected,
  rather than whether `'end'` has been emitted
